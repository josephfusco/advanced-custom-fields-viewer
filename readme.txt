View Advanced Custom Fields names & data on the front end of your theme while developing.

== Description ==

If you are working with a large number of fields in Elliot Condon’s Advanced Custom Fields, chances are you manually wrap print_r inside of pre tags while building themes. Sometimes you just need all the fields you are working more accessible and out of the way. You will be able to bounce back and forth between fields on your current page and the options page if available, and quickly close the menu once done.

Once you activated, your ACF field data will never be in the way of your design again!

== Installation ==

1. Upload \'advanced-custom-fields-viewer\' to the \'/wp-content/plugins/\' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
3. Click on the new menu item \"ACF Viewer\" for plugin options
4. Hover top left of the front of your site to see the toggle button for all available ACF fields for the current page, as well as the options page if avaialable.
